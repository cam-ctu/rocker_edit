use the dockerfiles.yaml to make a pull reqest that can check for changes
a)  checkout the main rocker repo
b) copy across -
	a) workflows
	b) scripts
	c) build/readme
	 /knitreport
	 /scripts
	 /templates//
	d) test
	3) otehr top matter Makefile  .  not the readme though.

make dir
	build/args
	/matrix
	/reports
	/variables
	bakefiles
	dockerfiles

run rscript that makes the ammendments needed.
	
	
set up Docker account for cam-ctu
use kdiff3  with a merge on the old repo to work out what needs to be edited and how


Trim down the amount that is copied across.  maybe not all the scripts, templates (but might still want to see differences if changes are made in main repo)


I had to 1) within organisation settings allow tokens 2) from my account (top right> settings> Developer Settings> TOkens) 
 create a token with the 3 permissions needed.
3) copy the secret output to a secret within the repository 4)  add ` tokens: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW}}` to 
the yml file..  Not well documented at alll!!



---------

Work out how extra.docker-bake.json is created,  so as to add in the extra fields. for cctu..

Check up on reports creation,  maybe edit to use the shug0131/rocker_version2. 

try out devel...

Check that update-repo works -- weird error for copying across Makefile...



# map the actions triggers to understand better. 


force 4.4.1 to build
give better README.me.  Maybe edit the reports and wikis. 

make pull request to install_verse.sh  on the rocker repo

Look at Validation to see scale of needs. Add extra packages?
Try to get out the next 4.4.1 for live use before holidays.
