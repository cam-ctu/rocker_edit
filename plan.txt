I had to 1) within organisation settings allow tokens 2) from my account (top right> settings> Developer Settings> TOkens) 
 create a token with the 3 permissions needed.
3) copy the secret output to a secret within the repository 4)  add ` tokens: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW}}` to 
the yml file..  Not well documented at alll!!
